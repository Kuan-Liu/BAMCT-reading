# Chapter 1 Statistical approaches for clinicla trials

## Bayesian versus frequentist appraoches in clincial research

- Key differences
    - parameters
    - inference input data and prior
    - **flexibility**, sequential learning
    - probability statements, predictive probabilities
    - decision theoretic 
    - comment on role of randomization
    
Additional reading
- [Beyond subjective and objective in statistics by Andrew Gelman and Christian Henning](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/gelman_hennig_full_discussion.pdf)
    - Bayesian is no more subjective than frequentist
    - Prior can be used meaningfully both computationally and biologically
    
## Adaptivity

Bayesian is more commonly used for Phase I and Phase II trials. Some appealing adoption including non-fixed sample-size, early stopping and adoptive randomization.

### The book argue "full bayesian" with utility function is awkward.

- the expected utility function given poster distribution of the parameter
- an example utility gain (or loss): Y(Z=1, treated)-Y(Z=0, control)

$$ \int u(\theta, x) p(\theta |x)d\theta $$

### Bayes as a frequentist tool
- flexibility, sequential learning
- posterior predictive probability
- use of prior, borrow info from other studies
- adaptive randomization
- seamless phase II and III design

## Principles of Bayesian clincial trial design

Methods which can be used for clinical decision making

1.  Posterior predictive methods
2.  Bayesian indifference zone methods

3. Use of priors
4. Operating characteristics - Bayesian trial sample size

1. Example Bayesian trial, Advanced reperfusion strategies for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and refractory ventricular fibrillation (ARREST): a phase 2, single centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32338-2

 - The use of potentially optimistic treatment effect target belief
 - Cost of using ECMO versus control

2. P-value versus Bayes factor, confidence interval versus credible region. (http://www.utstat.toronto.edu/mikevans/jeffrosenthal/chap7.pdf)
